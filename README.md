# Movie Trailer Website
Fresh Tomatoes is a website that displays my favorite movies and their trailers. Project 1 for Udacity's Full Stack Web Developer nanodegree. Written using Python, HTML, and Javascript.

## Getting Started
First, make sure that Python is already installed by typing the following in the terminal:
```
$ python --version
```
If it isn't, you can download and install [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

To clone the repository and move into the folder:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/evashek/Movie-Trailer-Website.git
$ cd Movie-Trailer-Website
```

## How to run
Through the **terminal**, type:
```
$ python entertainment_center.py
```
OR

Through the **Python IDLE GUI**, open the file `entertainment_center.py` and click on `Run > Run Module` in the menu bar.


An HTML page titled `fresh_tomatoes.html` should be created and opened through a browser showing my favorite movies.
