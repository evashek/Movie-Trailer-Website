# Movie Trailer Website
Fresh Tomatoes is a website that displays my favorite movies and their trailers. Project 1 for Udacity's Full Stack Web Developer nanodegree. Written using Python, HTML, and Javascript.

## Getting Started
The website was written using Python version 2.7 so keep in mind that there may be discrepancies when using Python 3. First, make sure that Python is already installed. You can check this by typing the following in the terminal:
```
$ python
```
If you find that it isn't, you can download and install it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

To clone the repository and move into the folder:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/evashek/Movie-Trailer-Website.git
$ cd Movie-Trailer-Website
```

## How to run
Through the **terminal/cmd**, navigate to the directory where the files are located and type:
```
$ python entertainment_center.py
```
OR

Through the **Python IDLE GUI**, open the file `entertainment_center.py` and click on `Run > Run Module` in the menu bar.


An HTML page titled `fresh_tomatoes.html` should be created and opened through a browser showing my favorite movies.
